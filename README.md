# Sentiment-analysis-on-streaming-Twitter-data-using-TensorFlow-Python.
This project connects to the Twitter API and perform sentiment analysis on tweets searched by a keyword. 

In this project I trained a Machine Learning model in TensorFlow for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis, the model was trained with this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140), I used the Flask framework to connect Python, HTML and Jinja, I also used numpy and pandas to clean the dataset and the streaming data.  

You can search for a keyword and set the number of tweets that are going to be shown, and the machine learning model will say wheter the tweet is positive or negative.

You can see how I connected to the Twitter API and how I trained the machine learning model in this [blog](https://medium.com/@mamuchino9/machine-learning-sentiment-analysis-on-streaming-twitter-data-using-tensorflow-python-6edfd540e5ed)
